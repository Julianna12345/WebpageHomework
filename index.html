<h2>Me, Myself and I</h2>
<p>I'm Julianna, a 15-year-old student from Latvia. I have a strong interest in medicine and enjoy spending time with friends and my beloved dog, who I adore. I have an amazing mother who supports me and I lead an active lifestyle, playing sports and staying fit. Despite having to create this blog for my teachers, I see it as an opportunity to write about myself, my interests, and experiences. Balancing my passions and studies can be challenging, but I am always up for an adventure.</p>
<p> For a couple of months I've been listening to The Neighbourhood - an American rock band. Their songs are up to my valley, but there is one that I love. It's called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRoWZPn2EEc&ab_channel=TheNeighbourhood-Topic" target="_blank">Wires</a>. Hope you like too!</p>
